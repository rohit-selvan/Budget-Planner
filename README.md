# Budget-Planner

The Budget Planner is a Python-based application designed to help users manage expenses for trips, events, or other special occasions. With a clean and intuitive GUI built using Tkinter, this tool allows users to set a budget, add categorized expenses, and visualize spending through a pie chart summary. Users can choose from common expense categories like accommodation, food, travel, shopping, and miscellaneous, ensuring that all types of costs are covered.

One of the standout features is the visual summary in the form of a pie chart, which provides a clear picture of how the budget is being spent across various categories. Additionally, users can save expense records as CSV files for future reference or further analysis. This makes the Fancy Budget Planner a practical and easy-to-use tool for organizing and tracking finances for any event or trip.
